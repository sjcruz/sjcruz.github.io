abstract: The Mesoamerican Reef System (MAR) is one of the largest coral reef ecosystems in the world, which supports unique biodiversity and provides critical ecosystem goods and services to nearly two million people. These ecosystems, and the goods and services they provide, are in decline due to a combination of local (habitat destruction, unsustainable fishing practices, rapid tourism growth, invasive species and pollution) and global threats (changes in climate and ocean chemistry). Replenishment Zones (RZs areas of ocean protected from all extractive and destructive activities) can reduce local threats and be powerful tools for fisheries management, biodiversity conservation and adaptation to changes in climate and ocean chemistry, but only if they are well designed and managed. To date, each of the four countries with jurisdiction over the MAR (Belize, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico) have used different approaches to design and implement their own networks of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), including RZs. So far more than 50% of the MAR is protected within MPAs, but only 5.03% is within RZs. Since the MAR is one large, ecologically connected system, a more coordinated regional approach to designing a network of RZs is required. Scientists and managers are now working towards designing and implementing a network of RZs throughout the MAR, which will build on the networks already being established in each country. As the first step in this process, weâ€™ve used the best available science to develop 13 biophysical design principles for the MAR, which aim to maximize biological objectives, by taking into account key biological and physical processes in the region. These principles relate to seven categories regarding habitat representation, risk spreading, protecting critical, special and unique areas, incorporating connectivity, allowing time for recovery, adapting to changes in climate and ocean chemistry, and minimizing and avoiding local threats. A scientific rationale for each principle is also provided, along with explanatory notes and research priorities for refining the principles further in future (particularly regarding understanding more about larval connectivity, changes in climate and ocean chemistry and the ecology of focal species, and the implications for designing networks of RZs). These biophysical design principles are intended to contribute to larger planning processes that will include integrating RZs within broader planning and management regimes, and implementing RZs to complement human uses and values and align with local legal, political, and institutional requirements.
