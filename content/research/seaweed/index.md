abstract: Belizeâ€™s fisheries, like so many around the world, are in decline. The cumulative impacts of climate change, coastal development and unsustainable fishing practices threatens the viability of the fisheries industry and the livelihoods of people who depend on it. Fishers are finding it harder to secure stable incomes, resulting in increased fishing pressure, and thus, further aggravating the situation. The Nature Conservancy has been working closely with the Placencia Producers Cooperative Society Limited (PPCSL), a fishing cooperative, in piloting sustainable seaweed farming that employs fishers and women in the community. Sustainable seaweed farming has the potential of being a part of the solution for fishers and fish alike. Belizean fishers have traditionally harvested seaweed while fishing as supplemental income to the traditional catch of lobster, conch and finfish. In addition to providing additional income for fishers, sustainable seaweed farms provide habitat for coral, conch and lobster recruitment and may promote replenishment and restoration. Through an agreement with the Government of Belize, seaweed farms are set aside as no-fishing (no-take) areas with the exception of harvesting seaweed allowing for protection of nursery sites for conch and lobster. The scheme has proven to have the potential for scaling up, providing sustainable livelihoods while also aiding in restoring commercially important species. This model could protect biodiversity, promotes food security and diminishes climate vulnerability of fishing communities.
