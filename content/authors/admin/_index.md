Welcome to my site! I am an environmental and resource economist studying how communities adapt to climate change through their interactions with natural resources. My work lies at the intersection of environmental, development, and fisheries economics, with a focus on the behavioral and policy dimensions of adaptation in resource-dependent settings. I use econometric and bioeconomic modeling approaches to examine how environmental variability and management policies shape economic decisions.
