If you are a **prospective student** interested in joining my research group at **Texas A&M University at Galveston (TAMUG)**, I work at the intersection of **environmental and resource economics**, **climate adaptation**, and **fisheries management**. I especially welcome applicants with **strong quantitative/econometric and programming backgrounds** and an interest in climate-ready fisheries and human–natural systems.

**How to reach me:**  
Email is the best first contact: [scruz@tamu.edu](mailto:scruz@tamu.edu).  
Please include a **brief introduction** and the materials below.

## Prospective Graduate Students

Graduate students can typically join through **Marine & Coastal Environmental Science (MCES)** at TAMUG and related interdisciplinary pathways. If you’re considering applying, reach out **a few months before the program deadline** with:

- **CV**
- **Unofficial transcript**
- **One-page statement** describing your research interests, prior experience, and why you’re a fit
- *Optional:* a **writing sample** (e.g., thesis, paper, or report)

> Tip: In your note, feel free to suggest how your interests might connect to topics like **labor allocation under climate shocks**, **bioeconomic modeling**, **policy trade-offs under warming**, or **small-scale fisheries**.

## Postdoctoral Researchers

If you’re exploring **postdoctoral opportunities**, email me to discuss project fit and external/competitive fellowships. Include a **CV** and a **1–2 page project sketch** (question, methods, data, potential outlets), plus relevant timelines.

## Undergraduate Research

I periodically mentor **undergraduates** for research credit or structured RA roles (space permitting). Best time to inquire is **2–3 weeks before a semester** begins. Send a short note with your **interests**, **coursework/skills** (e.g., R, Python, econometrics), and **availability**.
